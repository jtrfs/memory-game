## How The Game Works
The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: **flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!**

**Each turn:**
```
- The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
- The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
- If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
- If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
- The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
- A modal appears to congratulate the player and ask if they want to play again. 
- It should also tell the user how much time it took to win the game, and what the star rating was.
```

## Game Functionality
The real-life game, players flip over cards to locate the pairs that match The goal is to recreate this effect in your project. There are a couple of interactions that you'll need to handle:

1. Flipping cards
2. What happens when cards match
3. What happens when cards do not match
4. When the game finishes
